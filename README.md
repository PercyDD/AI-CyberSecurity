Experimental Comparison of Two Metaheuristic Optimisation Techniques
  
  -Simulated Annealing
  
  -Clonal Selection Algorithm

In this project I created two optimisation techniques from scratch and evaluated them for a documented report. 

To run the simulated annealing, run main for SimulatedAnnealing.java

To run the clonal selection algorithm, run main for Population.java
